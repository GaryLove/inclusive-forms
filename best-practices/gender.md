## Best Practices

* Gender is not binary so do not present it as a binary choice.  
* Avoid use of the  “other” as a category for collecting gender data. 
* Use the nomenclature of the people whose data is being collected. Work with your community to learn how they self-identify.
* If you are presenting the option in a dropdown menu, don’t have the default set to show a gender.
* If you’re collecting data to pass along to a governmental or educational agency that uses “other” disclose how that data will be mapped to these options but still adhere to the below guidelines for your collection. 
* Use your power and advocacy to petition organizations and agencies who use “other” or binary choice for gender data to adopt these recommendations. 
* Revisit how your organization labels gender annually. The words people use to self-identify their race and ethnicity are not static.
