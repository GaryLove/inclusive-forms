## Best Practices

* Avoid use of the word “other” as a category for collecting race and ethnicity. 
* Avoid having “Two or more races” as an option, and instead allow for multiselect of all races and ethnicities that apply to an individual’s ancestry. 
* Use the nomenclature of the people whose data is being collected. Work with your community to learn how they self-identify.
* If you’re collecting data to pass along to a governmental or educational agency that uses “other” or “two more more races” as options, disclose how that data will be mapped to these options but still adhere to the below guidelines for your collection. 
* Use your power and advocacy to petition organizations and agencies who use “other” or “two or more races” to adopt these recommendations for their own data collection. 
* Revisit how your organization labels race and ethniciy fields annually. The words people use to self-identify their race and ethnicity are not static.
